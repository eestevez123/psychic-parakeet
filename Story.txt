Once upon a time there was this boy named John who thought that it wouldn't be the worst idea to skip his computer science lecture. So instead of 
going to lecture, John decided to take a nap. When John woke up from the nap, he noticed he had a couple of text message notifications on his phone.

It was from John's friend asking him to go out and play basketball after class. When John finished his CS class and planned to meet his friend, he received a text message from his CS X-team members. John suddenly noticed that he still didn't finish his X-team assignment and it was due today.

Luckily, John came to his senses and finished the assignment. X-Team 64 got 
full points on all of their members assignments and they all passed the
class Programming 3 with flying colors. They all lived happily ever after!
